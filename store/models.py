null=True sets NULL (versus NOT NULL) on the column in your DB. Blank values for Django field types such as DateTimeField or ForeignKey will be stored as NULL in the DB.

blank has no effect on the database, and null controls whether the database column allows NULL values.

blank determines whether the field will be required in forms. This includes the admin and your custom forms. 
If blank=True then the field will not be required, whereas if it's False the field cannot be blank.

The combo of the two is so frequent because typically if you're going to allow a field to be blank in your form, 
you're going to also need your database to allow NULL values for that field. The exception is CharFields and TextFields, which in Django are never saved as NULL. 
Blank values are stored in the DB as an empty string ('').
Ex:
models.CharField(blank=True) # No problem, blank is stored as ''
models.CharField(null=True) # NULL allowed, but will never be set as NULL

CHAR and TEXT types are never saved as NULL by Django, so null=True is unnecessary. However, you can manually set one of these fields to None to force set it as NULL. 
If you have a scenario where that might be necessary, you should still include null=True.

null=False, blank=False: This is the default configuration and means that the value is required in all circumstances.

null=True, blank=True: This means that the field is optional in all circumstances. (As noted below, though, this is not the recommended way to make string-based fields optional.)

null=False, blank=True: This means that the form doesn't require a value but the database does. 

null=True, blank=False: This means that the form requires a value but the database doesn't

null
Field.null

If True, Django will store empty values as NULL in the database. Default is False.
Avoid using null on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField because empty string values will always be stored as empty strings, not as NULL. If a string-based field has null=True, that means it has two possible values for "no data": NULL, and the empty string. In most cases, itâ€™s redundant to have two possible values for "no data"; the Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL.

For both string-based and non-string-based fields, you will also need to set blank=True if you wish to permit empty values in forms, as the null parameter only affects database storage (see blank).

blank
Field.blank

If True, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is False.

Note that this is different than null. null is purely database-related, whereas blank is validation-related. 
If a field has blank=True, form validation will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has blank=False, the field will be required.
